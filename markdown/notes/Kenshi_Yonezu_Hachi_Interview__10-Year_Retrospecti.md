### 10 Years Walking to Earnestly Confront Music, and Playlists From Five Respecters of Yonezu

Kenshi Yonezu debuted on May 16th, 2012 with his first album "diorama." To commemorate the 10th anniversary of Yonezu's debut, Natalie.mu has put together this special feature: a chronology summarizing his activity in those 10 years and our interviews with him from those times, a mini-interview with the man himself, and playlists of his work selected by artists who pay respect to Yonezu: Ayase (YOASOBI), syudou, Keina Suda, Masaki Suda, and Vaundy. We look back on Yonezu's last 10 years, never fearing change and steadily continuing to walk, establishing a position as a preeminent internet-born artist, and growing into a musician that represents Japan.

### Kenshi Yonezu's Ever-Changing, Never-Stopping 10 Years

- 2012

**May 16th**  
First album under his real name of Kenshi Yonezu, "diorama," released. Across every song, he was responsible for all lyrics, composition, arrangement, performance, and mixing, and the artwork and music videos were also created by him alone.

In 2012, Kenshi Yonezu was already receiving strong support in the internet scene. Starting by posting Vocaloid music to NicoNico Douga under the name "Hachi" in 2009, he released one hit after another, including "Matryoshka," "Panda Hero," and "Close and Open, the Rakshasa and the Corpse." He had become a Vocaloid producer who represented the scene. His first album under the Kenshi Yonezu name, "diorama," included not a single one of those popular Vocaloid songs, used his real name, and had him singing all the songs himself. Making not only the lyrics, compositions, arrangements, and mixing, but even the illustrations and videos himself, it took nearly 2 years from conception to completion. Daring to separate from the Vocaloid scene he called his "home" in the interview after release, challenging new ground by revealing his physical self, Yonezu's career began.

In 2013, Kenshi Yonezu had his major debut with the single Santa Maria. To Yonezu, who had worked all by himself up to that point, even making a whole miniature world with "diorama," this was also a declaration of his determination to make music out in the open and with the involvement of others. With this song, Yonezu acquired a clear will to make pop songs with a universal beauty and have them reach listeners. It was a turning point he described as "a major change in my approach to expression." Starting with Santa Maria, he attempted recording with a band, and for the creation of the single "MAD HEAD LOVE / Poppin' Apathy," he had not only guitarist and old friend Hiroshi Nakajima, but also bassist Yuu Sudou and drummer Masaki Hori. These three have become longtime members who accompany him at shows to the present day.

Eine Kleine, released in 2014, brought on Koichi Tsutaya as an assistant arranger. It marked the first time inviting in an external producer, after Yonezu had consistently self-produced ever since starting out. In part from having a song used for a Tokyo Metro ad campaign, receiving special notice as his first song to be part of a collaboration, YANKEE placed second in the Oricon weekly album rankings. Besides the album being a hit, he had his first one-man concert in June, and his first tour in December, making this year a big turning point in his career. Though not proactive about concerts at first, Yonezu's experience performing physically on stage and facing an audience surely served as fuel later on.

The album Bremen, which also included Unbelievers, earned first on the Oricon weekly album ranking and Billboard weekly ranking. In November, he took an invitation from his adored RADWIMPS and made his first appearance at a multi-band event. With a hearty amount of concerts and releases, it was a year of steady and rapid advancement.

In the music video for LOSER released in September, he tried dance for the first time. The dancer and choreographer who did the choreography for this song, Tomohiko Tsujimoto, would go on to give him private dance lessons, making this meeting a cornerstone in Yonezu's unique bodily expressions on stage and in music videos. In October, working with Yasutaka Nakata, they announced the theme song for the film Nanimono, "NANIMONO (feat. Kenshi Yonezu)." Providing lyrics and vocals, it was also his first experience contributing to another person's composition. 2016 was an ambitious year of seeking greater creative possibilities from collaborations in new domains.

2017 was a full-blown onslaught from Kenshi Yonezu. Successful releases of anime themes - in February, the March Comes In Like A Lion ending theme "orion," and in June, the My Hero Academia opening theme Peace Sign. With October's DAOKO x Kenshi Yonezu theme song Fireworks for the movie "Do You View Fireworks From Below, Or From the Side?", he had a long hit on his hands. The Hatsune Miku Magical Mirai 2017 theme song Sand Planet made under the Hachi name also prompted much discussion. The album BOOTLEG released in November served like an aggregation of all the various tie-ins and collaborations Yonezu had worked on. With Gray and Blue, he realized a duet with Masaki Suda by bringing it up himself, and for "fogbound," Elaiza Ikeda participated on vocals. With 爱丽丝 (Alice), Daiki Tsuneta (King Gnu, millennium parade, PERIMETRON) assisted with the arrangement, and Margarette Hiroi (88Kasyo Junrei) and Takuya Yao also took part. For the second time in a row, he earned first on the Oricon weekly album rankings, and BOOTLEG achieved sales surpassing his previous album.

The song immediately had a major impact; it was used for a SoftBank commercial, the music video surpassed 400 million views, and it sold a combined 3 million digital/physical copies, becoming a record-breaking hit that swept all kinds of yearly charts in 2018. Furthermore, in July, for the (NHK) 2020 Support Song project, he wrote the lyrics for, composed, and produced Paprika, sung by the grade-schooler unit Foorin. In October, he held a one-man concert at Makuhari Messe, and released his single "Flamingo / TEENAGE RIOT." In December, he even had his first performance over live broadcast, performing from the Otsuka Museum of Art in his hometown of Tokushima as part of the 69th NHK Kouhaku Uta Gassen. With the release of generation-defining pop songs, it was a breakthrough year for his stardom. Not only did he display brilliant work, with Flamingo, remarkably, he attempted to break new musical ground in a way that incorporated folk music.

After its Kouhaku performance, Lemon continued to be a long hit in 2019. While putting on larger-scale performances from January to March with his first arena tour and first overseas shows in Shanghai and Taiwan, he also made further efforts in music. Ghost of the Sea, theme song for the animated film Ghost of the Sea released in June, was another important song in his career. According to Yonezu, who encountered the original manga by Daisuke Igarashi as a teen, making this song felt like a major achievement. The orchestral arrangement was done by Yuta Bandoh, and this meeting would lead to more assistance with arrangement in the future. Also, Foorin's Paprika released last year became a social phenomenon among children, and in August he released a self-cover of it. In September, he released Horse and Deer as the theme song for the TBS Sunday show No-Side Game. With instances such as being played at the Rugby World Cup, it had a wide reach that even echoed into emotional moments in sports. Spot the Difference, the song provided for Masaki Suda released in May, was also a hit, and Suda made his first appearance at the 70th NHK Kouhaku Uta Gassen with it. Paprika won at the Japan Record Awards, and Foorin and Foorin team E appeared at Kouhaku. Furthermore, "Kite," written for Arashi, was first performed at Kouhaku; all sorts of songs worked on by Yonezu took the world by storm this year. As for Lemon, it made waves on yearly charts for the second year in a row, took first on Billboard Japan two years in a row in a historic first, and set a Recording Industry Association of Japan record for the fastest song to hit 3 million downloads - an astounding result.

Seeking ways to connect people while unable to properly come in contact, he held a global virtual event in the game Fortnite in August, as well as collaborating with Uniqlo UT to sell products globally.

In March 2021, Kenshi Yonezu turned 30. Faced with still no sign of a resolution to the novel coronavirus, he tried new experiments of experiencing songs through smell and taste, as a way of enjoyment even when staying home. Between Pale Blue, a head-on attempt at a love song, and the rakugo-motif Shinigami with an attention-grabbing video of Yonezu dressed as a storyteller, he ambitiously sought to break new ground in musical expression.

**May 18th**  
Twelfth single M87 released.

POP SONG, written for a PlayStation commercial and released in February, fostered much discussion not only for its tricky composition style, but the impactful visuals Yonezu brought to both the commercial and music video. The idea to have a bold transformation was his own. On March 18th, M87, written as the theme for the movie Shin Ultraman, will release. Starting in September, he'll hold his first arena tour in 2 and a half years, "Transformation." The title is a motif shared by both of these new songs released in 2022, but no doubt it also represents his stance as an artist who has believed in always changing. It makes one realize anew that as he continues to walk into explored territory, you just can't take your eyes away.

### Kenshi Yonezu, Darling of a Generation, Meeting the 10th Anniversary of His Debut

- <r>With it being the 10th anniversary of your major debut, what thoughts do you have looking back on the music you've released throughout your career?</r>

While taking a dance lesson the other day, the song provided was, unusually, one of my own. Though I really dislike listening to my old songs, I figured a time like this would be the time to do so if any, so I paid close attention, and reflected on how I had been doing this and that back then. Thinking back on it, I've changed an incredible amount in these ten years. I've always done the thing I thought was best at the time. And I've keenly felt how the present moment exists as the result of many twists and turns. There are probably things I definitely wouldn't have done now, and there are also things I can relisten to and be like "so this song really was this good." These ten years feel like an instant looking back, but I can sense the fact that I've always been earnest in my own way.

- <r>You have an impression of always challenging new things, shedding your old self, and steadily changing as you repeat the process.</r>

That's true. I'm continually changing, and I'm not at all where I imagined I'd be as a child. I think I've lived an interesting life, and part of me even wants to praise myself. Basically, I'll continue to give it my all.

- <r>I get the impression you've changed due to your meetings with those around you and those you create with. What has your interactions with others brought about for you?</r>

It might not be good to say things like this, but I want to always feed on other people's talent. So I think all my life, I've unconsciously chased after people who have things I don't have. By interacting with and making things with those people, the context they've built up through their lives gradually seeps into myself. And with that, my life slowly shifts once more into a totally different direction. I can't help but find it pleasing. Though of course, it's not like it's just me feasting away; I want to keep having the sort of relationships where we can say "you can take a bite right around here." I feel meetings like that have, luckily enough, put me in a good place. I'm incredibly grateful to all kinds of people.

- <r>Lemon was a major hit as a song, but what do you think of as the biggest occurrence in the past 10 years?</r>

From an outside perspective, I'm sure Lemon looks like the turning point, but there is a part of me that finds that doesn't really click, like "ah, I guess it's this." Of course it's a song I was incredibly confident in, but I didn't think it would catch on to that degree. To me, the moments where the things I want to express get updated are major occurrences. In that sense, my interactions with others certainly were a major influence, so I think Ghost of the Sea, the first song I made with (Yuta) Bandoh-kun who I now create music together with, was a wonderful song in which I was able to update and do things I wasn't able to before. I never in my life considered trying dancing, so I'm also glad I was able to meet (Tomohiko) Tsujimoto-san through LOSER. I imagine that those sorts of meetings with people at pivotal times in my life, and the music I was then able to create as a result, would be the most major events.

**Comment**  
Ever since my first proper interaction with his music buying the album BOOTLEG, I've liked his songs that always show off novel and bizarre ways of playing with sound. I see him as a good rival who stimulates me, and at the same time, an invaluable good friend who I can discuss my thoughts and opinions with without a care.

**Comment**  
The thought of "I want to see the world Kenshi Yonezu sees" is why I started in music.

In 2009, as a middle schooler, I found Yonezu-san (then named Hachi) by way of NicoNico Douga. From the moment I first heard one, I could tell his works had an overwhelming charm unlike anyone else's, and at the same time I wanted to know just what the nature of that charm was.

To that end, I started by listening to many of his songs. When studying, when going to school, when eating, even putting off sleep to listen to just one more. I learned the lyrics and how to sing them. I checked out all the music, movies, and books he recommended. I even imitated his fashion and way of speaking. Wanting to understand his viewpoint as a composer, I started making songs myself.

And before I knew it, I had quit my job to live doing music. Thinking back, that's really all my life was. Though I still don't know the true nature of that charm, there's one thing I realized recently. I think the feelings I felt for him were not some kind of reverence or love, but merely yearning. For my playlist, I selected songs that would serve as a digest of that life of mine.

I'm honored to have been contacted for this project. With pride that we're alive in the same era, I intend to put my all into my own music and kick some ass!

**Comment**  
Yonezu-san's music feels timeless, never fading in color.  
I chose songs that, as a listener of his, I couldn't possibly go without mentioning.

▽Go Go Ghost Ship  
My first experience with his music.  
Though I listened to his Hachi songs as well, I remember being shocked to learn after the release of "diorama" that they were in fact the same person.

▽Eine Kleine  
The affinity between the melody and words, and the weight that gives them, is tremendous.  
I was done in by the balance of logic and melancholy.

▽Sand Planet (+ Hatsune Miku)  
When I first heard it, I was unable to keep up all with the gimmicks and humor, so plentiful I couldn't write about it all here.  
It's a deeply emotional song for me as someone involved in Vocaloid culture.

▽Pale Blue  
I felt the purity untouched by dirtiness, and the stormy mental state beneath it, were simply beautiful.

Congratulations on your 10th anniversary, Yonezu-san.  
Thank you for always hearing me out on all kinds of things. Let's drink again sometime soon!

**Comment**  
01\. Shinigami  
Because I like the subject (classic rakugo).

02\. Rerun  
I'm an actor, after all, and I can sympathize with the universal imagery. Because it makes me feel "so Kenshi Yonezu is human too."

03\. Horse and Deer  
This song sticks in my memory; when I first heard it, it felt as if time had stopped, and I was incredibly overwhelmed.

04\. Let's / Isn't It  
It feels like deliberately not using proper language. Lyrics like a child using words they learned incorrectly. To have that over a rhythm is unreasonably cool.

05\. Cranberry and Pancakes  
A song I unconsciously start humming.  
When it's playing out around town, it feels so I good I want to hum along. To the point that I learned later on that it's a Kenshi Yonezu song. Like "Let's / Isn't It," I like the way it uses words.

I think Kenshi Yonezu the artist is the king of standards. Like Luffy from ONE PIECE saying "I'm gonna be king of the pirates," Kenshi Yonezu at one point saying "I'm gonna be king of the standards" left a strong impression on me. Some years later, he truly is a mainstay, and I think he really is like a pirate king.

And Kenshi Yonezu the human is a very passionate and kind person. I think if the world were full of only people with sensibilities like Kenshi Yonezu, maybe there would be no war and everything would be peaceful.

**Comment**  
Kenshi Yonezu-san is unmistakably an essential person in my musical history.

I think he was unquestionably the one to show the strength of being a singer-songwriter in the internet era. Since Yonezu-san's appearance, I've been able to witness the evolution of his music and the changing of eras to accept it. The sense of the sound and melody makes it feel like an attempt to represent the perfect shape of something in his head, and I think the feeling of unreality gives listeners the feeling of floatily being brought into his dream.

Out of them all, his second album YANKEE especially is exceptional.

I selected melodies that do just that, inviting you into Yonezu-san's dreams.
